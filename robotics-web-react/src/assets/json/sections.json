We host an annual Girl Powered STEM Day, inviting local K-12 students to our site to learn about STEM, promoting our future Women in STEM Initiative. Additionally, we participate in a district-wide STEAM-A-Palooza, exhibiting our team's yearly work for staff, parents, and students to enjoy. Other engagements within our school site include showing off our robots during Club Rush, rallies, Open House, Back-to-School Nights, and more. Through each event we host or participate in, our team builds a connection with our local community in order to promote STEM in the Anaheim Union High School District and Orange County."
